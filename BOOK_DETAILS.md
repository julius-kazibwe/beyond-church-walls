### Book Description

**Paragraph 1:**
For too long, many believers have separated faith from daily work—reserving worship for Sundays while viewing the rest of the week as secular.

**Paragraph 2:**
In *Beyond Church Walls*, Rev. John William Kasirye dismantles this false divide, revealing how workplaces—offices, classrooms, clinics, farms, and boardrooms—are sacred spaces where God's presence belongs.

**Paragraph 3:**
Drawing from Scripture, real-life stories, and his journey from statistics to ministry: Kasirye invites readers to rediscover work as worship and ministry as a lifestyle—not a title. Through practical tools like the WISE Framework (Worship, Integrity, Service, Excellence) and the Faith Relevance Index Quotient), this book equips believers to live out their calling with Purpose.
